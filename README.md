# GeneticAlg_Rebuild
This is a rebuilding of the genetic algorithm project that I did a few years back for a Programming Methedologies course.
It simulates a Darwinian, or "Survival of the fittest" simulation, and will involve one whole function (using various
smalle functions and a class to accomplish this).
It is still a work progress, with each function being built and tested before finally assembling it for the entire algorithm.
More information on how the algorithm can be viewed in the top comments on the 'Main.cpp' file.
